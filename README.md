We're providing an in-depth search of cloud-mining sites for users, who want to start mining on their own. By comparing what's available worldwide and reading the ratings we've provided, an aspiring miner can have an informed opinion on the available sites they can connect to.

Built with ArcGIS Javascript platform.

Our app is a resource for new miners, as well as larger companies, to analyze the environmental impact of their bitcoin mining, and help reduce their carbon footprint; for example, reduce their carbon footprint by setting up hydro-power and using the streams nearby to generate electricity for their mine. They can also look for alternative fueling stations to use to power their vehicles and gatgets as they set up their mining station. 

We know that Bitcoin and alternative (Alt) coins have enormous potential, and mining isn’t going to slow down anytime soon, so we’ve created an app for users looking to take up mining, who want to ensure that they reduce their carbon footprint as much as possible.
